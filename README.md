This is a work in progress. The test of getNextGeneration still needs much improvement.

With the console open in Firefox, open the html file. The unit tests will run automatically and display results in the console.

The my_gol.js file is the actual JavaScript code that's being unit tested.

NOTE: Don't use the Chrome browser. It can't load scripts with jQuery.getScript().
